# Database Management System

---

## Overview

Built during my Junior Business Systems Developer role at Hospital Arts (HARTS), Liverpool: Python & Tkinter desktop application centralising admin data, reducing the manual workload for members of staff.

Consolidates volunteers, partner universities, available roles, and artists into a single SQLite database with a clean user interface. Validated CRUD forms with quick search/filter & structured views for entities remove the need for spreadsheets and manual tracking, improving data accuracy and retrieval speed.

## What I've Learned

This project presented numerous challenges throughout all stages of development, offering valuable learning outcomes:
- **Planning & Collaboration**:The importance of efficient planning and collaboration with the stakeholders earlier on and establishing requirements would have avoided problems further down the line, like missing fields in the database.
- **SQLite**: This was also my first time using SQLite, although I have prior experience with MySQL, SQLite enabled me to utilise my SQL skills to develop and manage a relational database with a real-world purpose.
- **GitHub & Deployment**: Pre-releasing the application for internal testing and final deployment of my application gave me more exposure to GitHub's tools and improved my confidence using the platform, however, restrictions and security protocols within the NHSâ€™ internal systems had to be resolved in order for the system to be downloadable for the intended members of staff, these are real-world issues I could face during my time in the industry.

## Note

This application was developed and deployed for internal use for HARTS (NHS, Liverpool), but if you wish to download this for personal use, an empty SQLite database is included.

## Features

- **Volunteer Management:** Add, view, edit, and delete volunteers, including details like name, contact info, type, institution, role, start date, attending days, contract length, and status.
- **Institution Management:** Manage universities and colleges, including their names, types, and postcodes.
- **Role Management:** Define roles and associate them with multiple institutions.
- **Artist Management:** Track artists with their names, emails, and phone numbers.
- **Filtering:** Filter volunteers by type, institutions by type, and roles by institution.
- **Data Integrity:** Enforces foreign key constraints to maintain relational integrity.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Built with Tkinter and tkcalendar for date selection.
- **Data Input Validation** Currently being implemented.

## Technologies Used

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Primary IDE used throughout development.
- [SQLite 3](https://sqlite.org/): Used for storing and managing data for this application.
- [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/): Used for viewing the database's tables and data stored within them.
- [Python 3.13.2](https://www.python.org/): Langauge used for GUI and application logic.
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html): Python library used to build GUI.

## Project Structure

### Key Files

- `gui.py`: All GUI-related code, sends necessary data to the logic layer.
- `logic.py`: Holds the connection to the database, handles core application logic and SQL queries.
- `database.db`: Locally stored SQLite databse holding all application data.

### Branches Overview

- `viewing-logic` (merged): Viewing functionality.
- `add-logic` (merged): Add functionality.
- `editing-logic` (merged): Editing functionality.
- `deleting-logic` (merged): Delete functionality.
- `validation-improvements` (merged): Input validation & error handling.
- `final-additions` (merged): Final improvements and corrections before deployment.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- pip (Python package manager)
- DB Browser for SQLite
- IDE of your choice

### Installation

#### Option 1 - Packaged Executable:

Download the latest executable file (`.exe`) displayed in the **Releases** tab.

**Note** Upon the first startup of the application, a new `database.db` file will be created, this file **must** remain within the same folder as the `.exe`, all data will be lost otherwise.

#### Option 2 - Source Code:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Mattytomo365/Database-Management-System.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd Database_Management_System
    ```

3. Install dependencies (a virtual environment is recommended):

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
    source venv/bin/activate (MacOS)
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:

    ```
    python gui.py
    ```

### Usage

1. The database is automatically initialised, creating necessary tables if they don't already exist.
2. Use the main menu to access all primary features; viewing, adding, editing, or deleting.
3. Once a feature is selected, select the area of the database you would like to perform that operation on; volunteers, institutions, roles, or artists.
4. All changes are saved directly to the SQLite database.
